# YouTubeConverter
This application allows you to download YouTube videos as a video (generally MP4 format) or as an MP3.
It can also download YouTube playlist, assuming that the playlist is public.

I do plan on adding more features to the application soon (once I think of more things to add).

Thank you for checking this out!




This app should be used for personal use only. I do not own any of the pictures or gifs used in the program.
